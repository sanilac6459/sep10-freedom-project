My year-long project in my 4-year computer science course during my sophomore year, known as Freedom Project, was to create a website that showcases the connection between technologies with our chosen field based on the web design concepts we learned throughout the year such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I decided to build a site that focuses on technologies used in Visual Design, along with predicting future tech innovations.
