            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Visual Design is an industry where people make their designs aesthetically pleasing with modern trends such as textures, typography, color, shapes, form, and other design principles.</li>
                <li>Designers there have skills of creativity, professionalism, communication with their team, and being open-minded.</li>
                <li>They’re also problem solvers as they collaborate with other companies in making products to solve issues in our community.</li>
                <li>Their goal is to visually present their projects to the public in an efficient and attractive way to get the audience roped in their ideas.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="connection" class="container">
            <h3>Connection between VD and Tech</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I know what a lot of people are thinking - technology has nothing to do with Visual Design, they just draw and add colors on an actual poster board like kids use for science fair projects, that’s why it’s called visual.</li>
                <li>That’s true, they do present their ideas visually. However, through the process of planning out their ideas and organizing their info, technology is indeed involved.</li>
                <li>It helps designers work on their communication method with their team, improves quality while designing their products, keeps them motivated to try out new things, and it helps get feedback faster through social media and websites. Because of the tech sources they have in making their designs, it  can somehow motivate others to make their own designs too.</li>
